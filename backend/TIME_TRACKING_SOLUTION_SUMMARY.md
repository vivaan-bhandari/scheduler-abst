# Time Tracking Solution Summary

## What We've Built

A comprehensive time tracking system that integrates with Paycom to track actual clock in/out times and prevent overtime in your scheduling system.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Models Added

#### `TimeTracking` Model
- **Purpose**: Track individual clock in/out records per staff member per day
- **Key Fields**:
  - `clock_in`, `clock_out`: Actual times
  - `break_start`, `break_end`: Break times
  - `total_hours_worked`: Calculated hours (excluding breaks)
  - `regular_hours`, `overtime_hours`: Separated by 40-hour threshold
  - `status`: Clocked in/out, on break, no show
  - `paycom_sync_date`: Tracks when data was synced from Paycom

#### `WeeklyHoursSummary` Model
- **Purpose**: Weekly summary for cost control and scheduling decisions
- **Key Fields**:
  - `total_hours_worked`, `regular_hours`, `overtime_hours`: Weekly totals
  - `regular_rate`, `overtime_rate`, `total_cost`: Cost analysis
  - `can_work_more`, `should_avoid_overtime`: Scheduling flags
  - `is_overtime`, `is_under_hours`, `is_optimal_hours`: Status flags

### 2. Paycom Integration

#### Time Tracking Parser (`paycom/time_tracking_parser.py`)
- Parses CSV files from Paycom with clock in/out data
- Handles multiple date/time formats
- Creates or updates TimeTracking records
- Generates WeeklyHoursSummary records
- Links to existing Staff records by employee_id

#### Management Command (`sync_paycom_time_tracking.py`)
- Daily sync of time tracking data from SFTP
- Processes multiple files from date ranges
- Dry-run capability for testing
- Comprehensive error handling and statistics

### 3. Enhanced AI Recommendations

#### Overtime-Aware Staff Selection
- `_get_available_staff_for_week_with_overtime()`: Gets staff considering actual hours worked
- `_get_staff_for_shift_with_overtime_check()`: Assigns staff while avoiding overtime
- `_get_overtime_warnings_detailed()`: Provides detailed overtime warnings
- `_calculate_cost_analysis()`: Analyzes labor costs including overtime

#### New AI Recommendation Features
- **Overtime Prevention**: Won't assign staff who have worked 40+ hours
- **Cost Optimization**: Prioritizes regular hours over overtime
- **Real-time Warnings**: Alerts for overtime situations
- **Staff Shortage Detection**: Identifies when external coverage is needed

### 4. Frontend Components

#### OvertimeWarnings Component
- Displays overtime alerts and warnings
- Shows cost analysis with regular vs overtime breakdown
- Provides recommendations for staffing issues
- Visual indicators for cost optimization

## What You Need to Do in Paycom

### Single Change Required: Add Time Tracking Report

In Paycom's backend, create a new report with these fields:

```csv
Employee_ID,Employee_Name,Date,Clock_In,Clock_Out,Break_Start,Break_End,Total_Hours,Regular_Hours,Overtime_Hours,Facility_Code
```

#### SFTP Configuration:
- **Frequency**: Daily (6:00 PM + 8:00 AM)
- **File Name**: `TimeTracking_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_ReportID_TimeTracking.csv`
- **Directory**: Same as your existing Paycom reports

## Benefits You'll Get

### Immediate Benefits:
1. **Overtime Prevention**: System automatically avoids assigning overtime staff
2. **Cost Visibility**: Real-time tracking of labor costs
3. **Accurate Scheduling**: Based on actual hours worked, not assumptions

### Long-term Benefits:
1. **Reduced Overtime Costs**: Proactive prevention vs reactive management
2. **Better Staff Utilization**: Optimal hour distribution
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Historical labor pattern analysis
4. **Compliance**: Accurate time tracking for payroll and labor law

## How It Works

### Daily Workflow:
1. **Morning (8:30 AM)**: Sync previous day's time tracking data
2. **Real-time**: AI recommendations consider actual hours worked
3. **Evening (6:30 PM)**: Sync current day's time tracking data

### Weekly Workflow:
1. **Friday (2:00 PM)**: Complete Paycom sync (employees + time tracking)
2. **Scheduling**: AI recommendations use real hours data
3. **Cost Analysis**: Monitor overtime percentage and costs

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Paycom Time Tracking Report
1. Log into Paycom backend
2. Create "Time Tracking Report" with required fields
3. Configure SFTP push (daily at 6:00 PM and 8:00 AM)
4. Test with sample export

### Step 2: Update Your Cron Jobs
Add to your server's crontab:
```bash
# Daily time tracking sync
30 18 * * * cd /path/to/backend && python manage.py sync_paycom_time_tracking --days-back 2
30 8 * * * cd /path/to/backend && python manage.py sync_paycom_time_tracking --days-back 1
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. Generate test time tracking file from Paycom
2. Run sync command manually
3. Check AI recommendations include overtime warnings
4. Verify cost analysis displays correctly

## Example Time Tracking File Format

```csv
Employee_ID,Employee_Name,Date,Clock_In,Clock_Out,Break_Start,Break_End,Total_Hours,Regular_Hours,Overtime_Hours,Facility_Code
